Important files:
Our dataset creation occurs in tweets_race_age_csv_creation.ipynb
This file collects all information from the given json and csv files to create usable datasets.

The bulk of age prediction code is here:

Our attempts with profile pictures are here:

The rest of the files are either extraneous csvs that we did not use or failed attempts with various approaches. We kept them in the repo so that our full attempts can be seen.
